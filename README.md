# Conway's Game of life in Nim with SDL2

## Why?

Because I needed something to tinker with

## Install

You will [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html) as well as [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation) installed.

Then run `nimble build`.

The resulting binary is called `gol`.

## TODO
- capture window close
- support RLE import
- leave background color
- add cligen
